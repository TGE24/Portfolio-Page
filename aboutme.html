	<p>Idorenyin Obong (kingidee aka H.O.D) born on the 20th of October 1995 is a SoftWare Engineer, Google Certified Android Developer, Java & Kotlin, Technical writer based in Calabar Cross River State. I adore the creative process involved in the making of android apps, it's kinda addictive and the possiblities it gives are never ending, in essence i can say <strong class="about">I LOVE WHAT I DO.</strong> (be thrilled to hear from you regarding an Android App Development Project). Programming has always been a favourite and 2017 was a big step up for me into the tech world.<br><br>

	<strong class="heading"> EDUCATION </strong><br>
	I was able to successfully complete my B.Sc program at the end of the year 2017 at Cross River University of Technology Calabar, thank God! So in other news, I am officially no longer a college student and I am available full time (hint, hint). Lol!<br><br>

	<strong class="heading">EXPERTISE</strong><br>
	SoftWare Engineer | Google Certified Android Developer | Java & Kotlin
	<br><br>


	<strong class="heading">INTERNSHIPS AND PROJECTS</strong><br>
	I applied for and was successful (and unsuccessful) at the internships and projects that I managed. During the course of the year:
	I joined the Andela Learning Community (ALC) Program in April where we were attached to an online Udacity course. At the end of the program, I passed the pre-requisite exam to earn a Google Certification in Android development. Yay!!! This was one of the highlights of my 2017.
	I applied again for the 3rd edition of the Hotels.ng internship in August. This time around I wasn’t there to play! I was successful and was able to last till the end. I was one of the active contributors to the development of the Hotels.ng android app which is available for download on Google Playstore. At the end of the internship, I was one of those selected to be a part of the management and maintenance team for the app which i’m still a part of till date.
	In November, I applied to be a Campus ambassador for Ingressive Tech Community. I was selected and I led the Ingressive team at CRUTECH, other members of the team were Aghedo Femi and Joseph Bassey. This was the first time CRUTECH was hosting an event of this nature and I was glad we were able to pull it off (I wrote an article about the event and put it up here on Medium).<br><br>

	<strong class="heading">TECHNICAL WRITING</strong><br>	
	I have been able to write a couple which include:<br>
	<strong class="about">IMPLEMENTING PASSWORDLESS AUTHENTICATION FOR ANDROID USING TWILIO, FIREBASE & AUTH0.<br>
	DAGGER 2.11 WITH ANDROIN
	IDENTITY MANAGEMENT WITH AUTH0 USING KOTLIN PART I: AUTHENTICATION.<br></strong>This article was later published to the DevCenter blog where I am now part of the technical writing team.<br>
	<strong class="about">BUILDING A VIDEO TO GIF ANDROID APP USING KOTLIN & CLOUDINARY.</strong><br>
	In December, I was accepted as a Guest Author at Auth0 where I write android-related articles for publication on their blog.<br><br>


	<strong class="heading">SPEAKING AND COMMUNITY</strong><br>
	I spoke for the first time ever in a technical event at the <strong class="about">CRUTECH INGRESSIVE EVENT</strong>where I gave a keynote on; “Growing as a software developer through Communities”. I was uneasy when I started off but thankfully, the feeling passed after sometime. I hope for more of these, as I am starting to get a hang of this public speaking thing.
	In December, I became an Andela ALC Facilitator for Calabar, Nigeria. My work there involves helping beginners in the Andela Learning Community (ALC) 2.0 get started. On the 20th of January 2018 i was invited to be a guest speaker at GDG Uyo, on the Topic <strong class="about">KOTLIN FOR ANDROID</strong>. It was a big stepping stone for me and boy was man on fire<br><br>

	<strong class="heading">OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS</strong><br>
	I was able to hit 505 reputations on StackOverflow. This means a lot to me.
